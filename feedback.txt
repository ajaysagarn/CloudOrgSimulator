Homework 1

The maximum grade for this homework is 8%. Points are subtracted from this maximum grade: for example, saying
that 2% is lost if some requirement is not completed means that the resulting grade will be 8%-2% => 6%;
if the core homework functionality does not work or it is not implemented as specified in your documentation,
 your grade will be zero;

Grading Criteria:
 - only some basic cloud simulation examples from the cloudsim repo are given and nothing else is done:
    * Non-trivial simulations: -0%
 - having less than five unit and/or integration scalatests:
    * More than 5 tests present: -0%
 - missing comments and explanations from the simulation program:
    * Comments present: -0%
 - logging is not used in the simulation programs:
    * logging configured, but print statements used: -0.1%
 - hardcoding the input values in the source code instead of using the suggested configuration libraries:
    * configuration used: -0%
 - for each used var for heap-based shared variables or mutable collections:
    * multiple uses of var: -0.2%
 - for each used while or for or other loops with induction variables to iterate over a collection:
    * no loops found: -0%
 - no instructions in README.md on how to install and run your simulator:
    * Instructions present in readme.
 - the program crashes without completing the core functionality:
    * program run: -0%
 - the documentation exists but it is insufficient to understand your cloud simulation design and models and how you assembled and deployed all components of the cloud:
    * Documentation is sufficient: -0%

Total grade: 7.7%

Comments: excellent job on the documentation. I like how you simulated map-reduce jobs. Overall excellent job, just
check the grading criteria beforehand, so you don't lose points for things like using var, print, etc.
