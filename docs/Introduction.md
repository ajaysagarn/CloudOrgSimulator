## Introduction

This respository consists of several simulations aimed at analysing various cloud computing models and how choosing certain features/factors affect the overall price incurred from using such a cloud infrastructure.
We first run a simulation to understand the usage of diiferent types of Vm Scheduling and Cloudlet scheduling policies and study the cost metrics of the simulation by trying different combinations of schedulers. Next we look at
different types of dynamic scaling options i.e Vertical / Horizontal, and look at how using such scaling options can affect the performance and cost. Finally we simulate 3 types of cloud implementation models namely SAAS, PAAS and IAAS
and understand how certain pricing models and parameters selected for a model can afftect the overall costs for such a model.
